2:  A success page stating: "The install worked successfully! Congratulations!" and
    "You are seeing this page because DEBUG=True is in your settings file and you have not configured any URLs."
    This is a base page at the start of django projects.

3:  We get 404 not found when navigating to /, and it displays us a 404 page stating the request method,
    request url, and url patterns tried

4:  migrations will create the necessary database tables according to the database settings described in the mysite/settings.py
    file and existing database migrations. We need this to initialize our database for the models we have defined

5:  I can see that I can add choices and questions, which will add to their respective entries in the database. I can add additional
    users and group. I can also change all existing entries. Custom models will appear if they are registered to appear on the admin panel,
    so that entries can be added/changed.

6:  On /polls/38/ "You're looking at question 38." is displayed. For /polls/38/results/ "You're looking at the results of question 38." is displayed.
    On /polls/38/vote/ "You're voting on question 38." is displayed. If we put a string instead of a number, we get a 404 not found, with the 404 page being shown.
    In order allow arbitrary alphabetic characters, we would change '<int:question_id>/' found in the path call on line 8 in polls/urls.py to '<str:question_id>/'.
